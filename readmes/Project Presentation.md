## High-level summary of the project (about 50 words) include Project relevance
Aim: Management of a large dataset composed by behavioural data (sung performances) 

achieved by writing a program that is able to perform and automate the following steps
-Data cleaning
-Data organization
-Data visualization
-Data analysis (preliminary analysis)


Why this is important 

These goals are justified by the necessity to optimize time and ressources in managing and updating behavioural data that my lab is currently collecting.
The process is to eliminate almost entirely any type of manual work.
