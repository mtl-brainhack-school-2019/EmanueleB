# EmanueleB project for brainhack school 2019
## TITLE: Exploring behavioural patterns and statistical regularities of vocal improvised performances

## Who I am 
### I have a background in clinical psychology (certified psychologist in Italy), medical informatics and ... music (I'm a pianist, classical and jazz)

## Which dataset do I want to analyze?
### My dataset includes a collection of vocal renditions performed by several subjects.

## Which tools do I want to learn? 
### My intent is to learn python and more specifically learn some machine learning techniques 


## What are the main goals that I want to accomplish for my project?
### 1) Learn how to write a script that performs the following actions: 
#### - Access a folder 
#### - Identify and use a specific file type (.txt)
#### - Concatenate all the files needed into a single structured file (using the library pandas)

#### - Display the file
#### - Refine the code if necessary

### 2) Learn how to write a script that performs the following actions:
#### - Looping into other folders (a folder for each participant), 
#### - Gathers the specific filez I need (file type .txt)
#### - Concatenates them into the original file generated
#### - Organize the new file in a way that is comprehensible
#### - Display the file
#### - Refine the code if necessary

### 3) Learn how to perform some exploratory data analyses. Possible outcomes:
#### - Identify possible statistical properties (e.g. repeated patterns)
